# Crime_Managing_System

### INTRODUCTION

1.1 BACKGROUND
During this pandemic, crime rate did not go down as was expected. But instead, crimes against women and children increased, especially crimes like domestic abuse. This spike in crime rate unfortunately did not result in an increase in FIRs being filed though, as firstly, due to lockdown, people were not allowed to move out of their homes, and secondly, these perpetrators were mostly people from the victimsâ€™ close family. This situation gave us the idea to come up with a system that would allow these people to file FIRs from their own homes, without having to go out and catching the virus, and without alerting the abusers and criminals.
