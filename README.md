# Crime_Managing_System

### OBJECTIVE

Not only during pandemic, but even before, many a times, victims were ashamed of the crimes that they were subject to, and under familial and societal pressure, did not report the crime. This has been going on for so long, and due to this, many criminals go unpunished and keep on doing bad things. To prevent any victim in the future from being scared to report what happened to them, we have come up with this project. This system will also enable the police force to manage crime data and criminal information better and in a more organized way, which will increase their efficiency. The system will hold criminal details, use details, FIR details, and FIR status, amongst other things. It will also hold the information of missing people who are currently being worked on. It will allow only authorized users(police officers with login ID and password) to access the stores files, whereas the FIRs will be able to get filed by anyone.

### MOTIVATION

This system can be utilised by any police department across the country, this system is not only for the authorized higher officials, this is also for the common citizen of our nation. The citizens are given limited access to the portal, they can login and file a FIR, the view the status of their FIR and they can also get updated with the current local crime. To assure safety and proper functioning of each case , an officer will be appointed to a particular case and will stay in contact with the victim or the relatives. The status report of each crime will get updated everyday by the officer in charge. Police can also keep track of the missing citizens as well as the criminal yet to be caught.
